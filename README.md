# SpaceXCorrectionBot

A Reddit bot that looks for instances of "Space X" and replies with "SpaceX". Just a silly side project.

##### Notes
- reddit_bot.py imports config.py, replace the filler text with username, password, client ID, and client secret. The account information I used is not included in the repository due to it being confidential information
- the bot is currently not deployed onto a non-test subreddit
- created with the help of [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krTUf7BpTc0)
