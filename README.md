# SpaceXCorrectionBot

A Reddit bot that looks for instances of "Space X" and replies with "SpaceX". Just a silly side project.

##### Notes
- reddit_bot.py imports config.py, I have not included that file in the repository due to it containing the password and secret keys that the program needs to run
- the bot is currently not deployed onto a non-test subreddit
